            A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong) was an Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of India's missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.
            Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.

        <p class="eduRight">
            Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was born on October 15, 1931 in the town of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, Tamil Nadu, India. He came from a humble background - his father was a boat owner and his mother was a housewife. He was the youngest of five siblings and started school at an age when most children in India start - around four years old. He completed his schooling in Ramanathapuram Hindu Middle School and Schwartz Higher Secondary School before moving on to St. Joseph's College in Tiruchirappalli where he studied physics and mathematics. From there, he went on to the Indian Institute of Technology in Madras (now Chennai) where he studied aerospace engineering.
    
            After completing his education, Dr. Kalam started his career as a scientist at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) where he worked on developing missile systems for the Indian armed forces. In 1963, he transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he worked on the development of India's first satellite launch vehicle - the SLV-3. He continued to work with ISRO for many years, playing a pivotal role in the successful launch of several satellites including the Aryabhata-1 in 1975, which was India's first satellite.
    
            In 1980, Dr. Kalam returned to DRDO where he took up the challenge of developing indigenous missile technology for India's defence program. Under his leadership, DRDO successfully developed several

            During his five-year term as President of India, Dr. Kalam made significant contributions to the country in the areas of science and technology, defense, and education.

            In the area of science and technology, Dr. Kalam helped establish India as a nuclear power and oversaw the development of several indigenous missiles, including the Agni and Prithvi series. He also played a key role in increasing cooperation between India and Russia in the field of space research.

            In the area of defense, Dr. Kalam was instrumental in modernizing India's armed forces and expanding its nuclear arsenal. He also helped negotiate several major arms deals with foreign countries, including the purchase of fighter jets from France and Israel.

            In the area of education, Dr. Kalam worked to increase access to quality education for all Indians, especially those from rural and disadvantaged backgrounds. He also launched several initiatives to promote scientific research and innovation among young people.
